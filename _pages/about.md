From April 2023, I started working at <a href='https://global.honda/RandD/'>Honda R&D Japan</a> as a reseacher in <a href='https://global.honda/RandD/hgrx/'>Robotics</a>. 

I received a Bachelor's degree (2018) in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href='http://www2.mech.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/'>Department of Mechanical Engineering</a>, the University of Tokyo. I obtained a Master's degree (2020) and a Ph.D. (2023) in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href='https://www.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/soe'>Graduate School of Engineering</a>, the University of Tokyo.

I was a member of the Harada Laboratory (formerly <a href='http://www.nml.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/'>Mitsuishi-Harada Laboratory</a>) of <a href='https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html'>the University of Tokyo</a>, Japan.

Automating tasks by using robots is something I've been passionate about. During my graduation research, I worked on automating tasks of eye surgery using industrial robots. Notably, <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9695979'>TMRB22</a>, <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05567'>ICRA23</a>.

[](I have strong technical skills, particularly in robotics, system integration, and programming, and an academic background in engineering and surgical robotics.)

[](In my graduate studies, I've been working on automating tasks of eye surgery using industrial robots. Through this experience, I was impressed by the robot's potential to be versatile in dealing with various problems depending on how it is implemented. As the next step in my career, I would like to work with robots to solve everyday problems in society. Also, I would like to pursue a global career to expand my horizons and possibilities.)

[](Proficient: ROS, Python, C++, Linux
Knowledgeable: Kinematics, Quaternions, Constrained Optimization Algorithms)

[](Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.)
